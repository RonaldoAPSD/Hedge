# Hedge
Hedge Programming Language

Hedge is a programming language based off BASIC built in python.
This is my current project in progress. You can download it for use.
Its only current functional feature is the shell which you can mess around with.
I will be adding file support so you can compile files you make for the language
just like any other language in the future.

There are a lot of bugs currently that i am working on.

# Currently Works
Variables,
For loops,
While loops,
Braches (If, elif, else)

# Currently Bugged
Functions,
Lists

There are more features coming in the future but im mainly focused on getting functions and list/arrays
working.
